# Computational Physics Fortran codes by Koonin and Meredith

  

These are the sample codes that go along with the textbook “Computational Physics” by Steven E. Koonin and Dawn C. Meredith.  The book is still available through Taylor and Francis.

 The codes are in Fortran (since they were written about 1987!). The codes are meant to be used as a learning tool.  You can start with what we have a play around with parameters and solution methods.
 
Since this is a very old project (started about 1985), there is no one maintaining these files or providing help.
