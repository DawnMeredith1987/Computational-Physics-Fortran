Codes to accompany "Computational Physics" by Koonin and Meredith

These are the sample codes that go along with the textbook “Computational Physics” by Steven E. Koonin and Dawn C. Meredith.  The book is still available through Taylor and Francis at this link. https://doi.org/10.1201/9780429494024 (as of January 2024).

These codes give you a starting place to explore Computational Physics and simple numerical algorithms.  Users are invited to download the codes and edit (change physical and numerical parameters) to gain a better understanding of the algorithms and the physics.  

Since this is a very old project (started about 1985), there is no one maintaining these files or providing help.
